<h1>Novel draft</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 - Reonie</h2>
<p>My pager beeped for the fourth time, and it was only midday. Emergency. Or urgent task. It’s difficult to think of it as an emergency when your work involves sitting on a desk and waiting for a computer analysis to finish.</p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting a slow pace when I accepted this position at the R&D, but today’s demands were out of the ordinary. Code 2248. A FASTA file was awaiting in my computer for my analysis. I grabbed my coat and rushed from the R&D’s cafeteria without finishing my lunch to the elevator taking to the laboratory.</p>
<p>“Summoned too?” Jim said as the elevator door opened.</p>
<p>“If only we had the context of the data we are analyzing, but the personnel of the level below is shut.”</p>
<p>“NDA.”</p>
<p>What R&D had under work that needed NDA between its own employees was still beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>“I mean, I will know what it is.”</p>
<p>“Oh, will you? How so?” Jim asked.</p>
<p>“If nobody wanted me to know what it was, they shouldn’t send me the amount of data they are sending me. Eventually, anyone can filter the noise and connect the points when they have all this data.”</p>
<p>“Not anyone, Reonie.” Jim smirked.</p>
<p>Jim have been working here for longer than I, which means he could know. However, he was also in Level 1 for years, working on the same tasks as I. Genetics, epigenetics, engineering. Old man stuck on the same job, but respected among the staff. The pager beeped again as the elevator's door opened to Level 1 and I left Jim behind. Code 2240. Image analysis. That was a first. I went to my desk to see the check the FASTA file. I opened the file, and it wasn’t a regular FASTA file. Besides the genomic data, for each GTCA nucleotide, there were marked points of what I didn’t know what was, but the size of the data was what impressed me: ten tera nucleotides. The header of each sequence had “Prototype” followed by a number attached to it. This prototype, whatever it was, had an absurd long genome.</p>
<p>I opened the file with instructions attached and it read “Reconstruct and simulate cell with custom genome. Reply with solution only.” I opened the file for image analysis. A full eukaryotic cell mapped, metadata attached, but missing genome. I saw my task. Generate the 3D form of the genome inside the cell, simulate a working cell. The first was reasonable, but simulating an entire cell wasn’t something ever done before. By anyone. Impossible. Not to mention a genome with ten tera nucleotides was much beyond any genome found in any organism. The largest know genome belongs to a plant, the Paris japonica, with one hundred and fifty giga nucleotides, far more than the insignificant human genome with its three giga nucleotides. A plant wins humans. I had to work on this, and send back.</p>
